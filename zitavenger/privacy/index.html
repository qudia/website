        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

        <p>
            Qudia built the ZitAvenger app as
            a Commercial app. This SERVICE is provided by
            Qudia and is intended for use as
            is.
        </p>
        <p>
            This page is used to inform visitors regarding my
            policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal
            Information if anyone decided to use my Service.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you choose to use my Service, then you agree to
            the collection and use of information in relation to this
            policy. The Personal Information that I collect is
            used for providing and improving the Service. I will not use or share your information with
            anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.
        </p>
        <p>
            The terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings
            as in our Terms and Conditions, which is accessible at
            ZitAvenger unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy.
        </p>

        <p><h3>Information Collection and Use</h3></p>

        <p>
            For a better experience, while using our Service, I
            may require you to provide us with certain personally
            identifiable information. The information that
            I request will be retained on your device and is not collected by me in any way.
        </p>

        <p><h3>Service Providers</h3></p>

        <p>
            I may employ third-party companies and
            individuals due to the following reasons:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>To facilitate our Service;</li>
            <li>To provide the Service on our behalf;</li>
            <li>To perform Service-related services; or</li>
            <li>To assist us in analyzing how our Service is used.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            I want to inform users of this Service
            that these third parties have access to your Personal
            Information. The reason is to perform the tasks assigned to
            them on our behalf. However, they are obligated not to
            disclose or use the information for any other purpose.
        </p>

        <p><h3>Security</h3></p>

        <p>
            I value your trust in providing us your
            Personal Information, thus we are striving to use commercially
            acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method
            of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic
            storage is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot
            guarantee its absolute security.
        </p>

        <p><h3>Childrenâ€™s Privacy</h3></p>

        <p>
            These Services do not address anyone under the age of 13.
            I do not knowingly collect personally
            identifiable information from children under 13. In the case
            I discover that a child under 13 has provided
            me with personal information, I immediately
            delete this from our servers. If you are a parent or guardian
            and you are aware that your child has provided us with
            personal information, please contact me so that
            I will be able to do necessary actions.
        </p>

        <p><h3>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h3></p>

            time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page
            periodically for any changes. I will
            notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on
